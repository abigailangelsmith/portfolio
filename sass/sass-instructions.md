# Using Sass within this project

### Instructions to follow for auto-compliation of styles.css file

Run 'npm run sass' within the terminal in order to watch the ==sass/main.scss== file for saving and auto-compile the ==assets/styles/styles.css== file.

The ==main.scss== file is only used to import sass partials in order to build the main ==styles.css== file that will be linked on the website.

When making sass changes, the ==main.scss== file will need to be saved - even when there are no changes within this file - in order to pull through<br> 
the changes made from within the partial sass files that are imported and rebuild the ==style.css== file.
